                        <p>It is easy. We know what we are doing. The other guys just build on top of Wordpress.</p>
                        <p>Rather than doing that, we actually use html, css and javascript to build websites.</p>
                        <p>There is only so much customization you can pull out of Wordpress before it starts to limit you.</p>
                        <p>We also <b>do not</b> build from scratch, or make complicated APIs or AJAX calls to complicated APIs.</p>
                        <p>No matter how good you are, building an API that is not going to fail takes a lot of developer time. Far more than simple static pages that are good enough for non-tech businesses take.</p>
                        <p>Building from scratch takes a lot of extra and unnecessary time as well. So why do that, when we can simply re-combine our existing components into something new and beautiful for you instead.</p>
                        <p>All these things combine to mean that we do not have to charge you upwards of $5000 for a simple business website.</p>
                        <p>It also means no surprise bills for lisence renewals for the premium Wordpress Theme you <b>did not</b> know you were using.</p>
